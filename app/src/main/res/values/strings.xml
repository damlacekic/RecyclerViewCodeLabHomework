        Talkin in my sleep at night
        Makin myself crazy
        (Out of my mind, out of my mind)
        Wrote it down and read it out
        Hopin it would save me
        (Too many times, too many times)
        My love, he makes me feel like nobody else
        Nobody else
        But my love, he doesnt love me, so I tell myself

        Two, dont let him in
        Youll have to kick him out again

End of passion play, crumbling away
Im your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death&apos;s construction
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You&apos;re dedicated to
How I&apos;m killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master

Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams

Laughter, laughter

Laughing at my cries

Fix me

Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster

Looking at life through the eyes of a tire hub

Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

New, what do you own the world?

Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder

More wood for their fires, loud neighbours
Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck

    I caught it bad yesterday
You hit with me with a call to your place
Ain\'t been out in a while anyway
Was hoping I could catch you throwin\' smiles at my face

Romantic talking? You don\'t even have to try
You\'re cute enough to fuck with me tonight
Lookin\' at the table all I see is weed and white
Baby you livin\' the life but nigga you ain\'t living right

Cocaine and drinking with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I\'m not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain\'t in your garden, you know that you can

Call me when you want
Call me when you need
Call me in the morning
I\'ll be on the way

Call me when you want
Call me when you need
Call me out by your name
I\'ll be on the way, like

I wanna sell what you\'re buying
I wanna feel on your ass in Hawaii
I want that jet lag from fuckin\' and flyin\'
Shoot a child in your mouth while I'm ridin'

Oh, oh... Why me?
A sign of the times every time that I speak
A dime and a nine, it was mine every week
What a time, an incline, God was shining on me

Now I can\'t leave
And now I\'m actin\' hella elite
Never want the niggas that\'s in my league
I want to fuck the ones I envy (I envy)

Cocaine and drinking with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I\'m not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain\'t in your garden, you know that you can

Call me when you want
Call me when you need
Call me in the morning
I\'ll be on the way

Call me when you want
Call me when you need
Call me out by your name

Tell me you love me in private
